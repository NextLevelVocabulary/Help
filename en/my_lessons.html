<h1>My Lessons</h1>
<p>My Lessons will allow you to create and learn customized lessons in very short time. This is very useful when you need to learn words in a very short time and remember them for short period too. Creating your own lesson is very easy and it can be completed under a minute. These pages were primarily designed to create your own content, but you can also browse lessons which other people created and shared with the remainder of the user community.</p>
<p>Check out a more detailed <a href="my_lessons_intro.html">instructions how to create your first lesson</a>. </p>
<p>My Lessons are used to gain short term knowledge, but they does not replace the long term learning which relies on the &ldquo;Spaced repetition&rdquo; process. My Lessons are very useful when you need to prepare for a test, exam or the next lesson in your language course. You can temporarily boost the your learning progress, but you should rely on the daily Review to remember the words permanently. Words from My Lessons will be automatically added to your active vocabulary and they will be included in your daily Reviews. </p>
<p>Remember that Review is the only activity which changes the word proficiency, which means that all practice activities in My Lessons will not affect the word proficiency rating. </p>
