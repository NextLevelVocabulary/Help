<h3 class="western">Recap Activity</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Recap allows you to review the words
  from today session. Recap helps you learn the words even better
  during the time among the sessions. You forget words over time and
  with Recap, you can review them more frequently during the day. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <td width="9%" valign="top"><img src="/android_asset/help/images/scrs_startPractice.png" width="120" height="200" /></td>
    <td width="91%" valign="top"><span style="margin-bottom: 0in">Recap
  lets you choose which groups of words and which exercises you would
  like to use, so you can be very specific on what and how you would
  like to learn. You can only recap the flashcards which were reviewed
  or learned today. The first screen in Recap allows you to choose the
  groups of words for the recap session. In the next step, you can
  select from the checkboxes which exercises you would like to practice
  for these flashcards. </span></td>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The best way to use this activity is to recap the words that you missed during
  the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_review.html">Review</a> and the words that you just <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practicetypes.html">learned</a>. You should  allow at least two
  hours gap between the Recap sessions and run one or two recaps during
  the day in between the sessions. <br />
  <br />
  For example, you can run the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_review.html">Review</a> in the
  morning and then you can  run another Recap in the afternoon and perhaps one
  more Recap in the evening. This way you can get the most out of the
  words from the daily session. You can also combine the exercises &ndash; in
  the morning you can  do <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_browse.html">Browse Cards</a> and <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_mchoice.html">Multiple Choice</a>. In the evening
  you can run <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_browse.html">Browse Cards</a> and some Typing exercise like the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_hangman.html">Hangman</a>. It is all about
  consistency and by taking little steps and coming back daily, you can
  build long term knowledge about the words. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Keep the recap sessions
  very short and very specific, you can target learning only the words  which you
  need to learn. See some <a href="/android_asset/help/en/best_practices.html">best practices and other learning tips</a>. </p>
