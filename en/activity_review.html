<h3 class="western">Review Activity</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="background: #ffff00"><img src="/android_asset/help/images/scrs_reviewA.png" width="120" height="200" hspace="5" align="left" /></span>Review is the first activity of the day
and the only one changing your <a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">proficiency</a>. Answers during Review will affect  your learning curve for  each word.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> The program will prepare a mix of new cards every day based on spaced repetition learning. You will assess
  how well you know the flashcards. Your answers will determine
  when you review the card again, because the program will tailor the
  speed to your learning performance. This program uses
  spaced repetition, which means that the words which you remember
  easily are scored more highly and are repeated less and less
  frequently, whereas words that are more difficult are repeated more
  frequently - hopefully until they are well known and remembered.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to make your daily learning
  session flow nicely, the daily exercises are configured in the user
  preferences. The application will not prompt you for the daily
  practice and the exercises will be executed in the order defined in
the user preferences. To change the practice exercises, go to  <a href="/android_asset/help/en/preferences.html">preferences</a>  for more details.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Your will be dealing with the
  forgetting curve on daily basis, so this is why it's important to use
this program couple times a day. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The set of flashcards for your review
  session is generated daily freshly. Your review session needs to be
  difficult, but also easy and enjoyable at the same time. This way you will keep coming back everyday and
you will keep learning.</p>
