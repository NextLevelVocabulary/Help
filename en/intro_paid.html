<h3>Next Level English Vocabulary - FULL version </h3>
<p>First of all, I would liket o thank you for purchasing this app. Full version will grant you unrestricted access to all sections and exercises in the app. The FREE version has a lot of restrictions built-in and they will be activated in May 2013 or sooner. FULL version has the following advantages.</p>
<ol>
  <li>No restrictions when using integration with Wordnet or seznam.cz </li>
  <li>All practice exercises are unrestricted </li>
  <li>New practice exercises will be added, most will be only in the full version</li>
  <li>New section will be added focusing on use of your vocabulary in sentences </li>
  <li>You are temporarily unrestricted access to MyLessons (I do not plan to shut My Lessons down, but I do not guarantee long term functionality of this section) </li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to expain the purpose of the two versions. If you have been using the app for some time, you probably do not want to loose your learning progress. It is technically fairly difficult to migrate your data from the FREE app to the FULL app. But by installing FULL app, all paid content in the FREE app becomes unlocked. The FREE app will recognize that you purchased the FULL version and it will automatically unlock all paid content.</p>
<p>If you do not mind loosing your learning progress, you can uninstall the FREE version and start again with the FULL app. In the other case, I woud recommend to keep using the FREE app which will automatically enable the paid content anyway.</p>
<p>I am planning to add new functionality which will be only available in the FULL version (ie. MyLessons is for free only until May 2013). I would like to add two new practice exercises and my main target is to add section MySentences. </p>
<p>I wish you all the best in learningn and fast progress in the vocabulary retention.</p>
