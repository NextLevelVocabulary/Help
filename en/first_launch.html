<p>The daily learning routine is based on three different practice sessions</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/android_asset/help/en/activity_review.html">Review practice</a> will select few words from your <a href="/android_asset/help/en/my_vocabulary.html">dictionary</a> every day. You will rate your knowledge and this is the only practice which changes your flashcard <a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">proficiency</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/android_asset/help/en/activity_missed.html">Reminder practice</a> will repeat the words which you did not
      know during the Review session. You will learn all the flashcards which you did not
      remember. The default practice quiz is <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_hangman.html">Hangman</a> and <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_mchoice.html">Multiple Choice</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/android_asset/help/en/practicetypes.html">Learning practice</a> will include few completely new words. The program will enable few new words and they will be added to your active <a href="/android_asset/help/en/my_vocabulary.html">dictionary</a>. You will go through the same practice exercises to learn
      new words.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="western" style="page-break-before: always">The Learning Process</span></h3>
<p>It takes some time before you fully master a <a href="/android_asset/help/en/flashcard.html">flashcard</a> and this program uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a> method to help you learn faster and fight against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">Forgetting Curve</a>. You will Review each word in planned intervals, new or <a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">low-proficiency</a> cards will be reviewed more frequently, <a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">high-proficiency</a> cards will be reviewed less often. </p>
<p><img src="/android_asset/help/images/forgetting_curve.png" alt="Forgetting Curve" width="428" height="270" /></p>
<p>By
  default you will start with English-Czech flashcard, than move to
  Czech-English level and the final level  is Audio-Czech.
  Your proficiency changes after each <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_review.html">Review practice</a> and the proficiency is
  displayed as a little colored dot on the flashcard. You will activate the next level flashcard after the flashcard proficiency dot becomes green. More details are described in the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">proficiency section</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="/android_asset/help/en/wizard.html">Installation Wizard</a> activated few thousand words for your  level of proficiency and it activated one of the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/card_levels.html">three flashcard levels</a>.  You need to review more flashcards in the first two weeks in order to skim all the words which you already know. You might find the first couple <a href="/android_asset/help/en/activity_review.html">Reviews</a> easy, but the more you practice, the more difficult it will get. It takes just one review to master most of the pre-set flashcards, which means the card deck will become smaller  and you will start learning more difficult words soon. You will notice the difference after two weeks, the sessions will become more customized to your needs. Don't give up, learning a language is a long process. </p>
<p>You should spend 15-30 minutes every day to go through the three
  mandatory sessions. Once you complete all three practices, the next
Review will not be available until couple hours. You can try the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/activity_recap.html">Recap activities</a> in the meanwhile. </p>
<h3>Few  tips </h3>
<p>You should increase the number of words in the Review  during the first two weeks. <a href="/android_asset/help/en/preferences.html">Change the preferences</a> temporarily to 150 flashcards &quot;Review per day&quot;, which will help you to reduce the volume of words in the initial  backlog. When the cards become more difficult, adjust the &quot;Review per day&quot;  values in the Preferences. </p>
<p>Check your <a href="/android_asset/help/en/statistics.html">statistics</a> page to examine your learning progress. The program will analyze your vocabulary and give you some learning tips. </p>
<p>If you used the two highest levels to install your <a href="/android_asset/help/en/my_vocabulary.html">dictionary</a> (Advanced and Serious!), you will have a lot of words to review
  initially and don't hesitate to use the &ldquo;I know it&rdquo; button in the options menu.</p>
<p>You can enable words of interest in the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/my_vocabulary.html">dictionary</a>. You will learn newly enabled word in the next Review practice. </p>
<p>Check more tips and recommendations on the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/best_practices.html">best practice page</a>. </p>
