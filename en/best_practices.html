<h2 class="western">Best Practices</h2>
<p>This application is quick to use and you can review few <U><a href="/android_asset/help/en/flashcard.html">flashcards</a></U> whenever you have time. You will learn the words starting with the
  English word showing and you will remember the word on the other
  side. If you guessed correctly, you move to the next card and the program will 
  update your <U><a href="/android_asset/help/en/proficiency.html">proficiency</a></U> for the word. You will review the
  flashcard couple times before the next level is activated. The Czech
  card or the Audio card will be activated when<strong> </strong>the <span style="text-decoration: none">proficiency</span> level is green. It takes at least 4-5 reviews to change your
  proficiency from red to green.</p>
<p>The best part of this method is that you don't need to allow any
  special time to learn your flash cards. Just have your phone on you
  at all times during the day and whenever a small moment appears,
  take your<strong> </strong>phone out and drill a few cards. Such hidden moments
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> Waiting in line at some desk, museum or cinema</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Commuting in public transports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Waiting on the phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Waiting at the restaurant</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The flashcards will be selected for you in order to learn the
  words faster. With learning, first and foremost, don&rsquo;t get angry if
  you don&rsquo;t remember something. Forgetting is normal and this program
  will help you to learn the words which you forget the most. Learning
  is a fight against forgetting. If you don&rsquo;t remember the answer,
  don't worry, because you will see the flashcard soon
  again. You will probably remember the flashcard better next time.</p>
<p>It is important that you have fun learning new words. You will
  learn a lot more if you enjoy the learning. This is why the program mixes
  different types of cards into your daily set. Check your <a href="/android_asset/help/en/statistics.html">statistics</a>  page for some hints about your vocabulary.</p>
