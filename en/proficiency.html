<h3 class="western">Proficiency</h3>
<p><img src="/android_asset/help/images/flashcardF.png" width="210" height="122" align="right" />Proficiency is measuring the degree of your familiarity of a
  flashcard. The proficiency is displayed as a little dot on the card
  with &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; colors. Each flashcard typically starts as
  red dot. While you will be become moring familiar with the meaning, the proficiency icon will be turn greener.
  Flashcard proficiency is updated only during the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/practice_review.html">Review</a> practice, based on your answers. </p>
<p>Proficiency for some cards is preset during the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/wizard.html">Installation Wizard</a>. Every new card will be started from beginning with a red dot, but you will see different colors.</p>

    <td><strong>Low proficiency</strong> - this is typically a new card, you are starting to learn it. You will usually not know this flashcard very well yet. It will take typically at least 5 reviews to progress to green and complete the flashcard. </td>

</table>
<p>The flashcard proficiency and your previous answers are
  influencing which words you review every day. You should understand
  how they impact your learning progress. In general, you will review
  words which you know less often and you will review trouble words
  more frequently. This is why it's so important you come back and learn
  every day, because otherwise your backlog will be too big.</p>
<p>When you reach green proficiency, the flashcard is deactivated and
  you will move to the <a href="/android_asset/help/en/card_levels.html">next level</a> flashcard. For example, after you learn
  the Czech-English card, the Audio only card is activated. </p>
<p>If you know the card well and you don't want it to be shown ever
  again, use the &quot;I know this word&quot; action
  in the Options menu. Please use this feature carefully and only for
  the words which you know well as a native speaker would.</p>
