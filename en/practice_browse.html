      <p><span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This practice is the most
straightforward   type of flashcard review. You can browse the cards
back and forth and skip the cards which you feel comfortable. This
practice is an endless loop and you will keep browsing until you skip all the
cards. This practice is best used when you start with every card in the deck, narrowing
down the scope to the words to the ones which are more difficult.</span></p>
      <p>This practice is great in combination with your daily recap.
        You
        can mix words with different difficulty and focus your learning very
        well.</p>

          <td valign="top"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This practice will display the
            flashcards in an endless loop. If you tend to remember the words in the
            sequence, you can change the browsing direction to
            make the practice more difficult<strong>.</strong> The cards will be
            displayed in an infinite loop unless you use the Skip button. The
            Skip button will remove the
            flashcard from the deck and you can focus only on the words which you
            don't know. Browse the card deck as many times as you want, back and
            forth, until you remember all the words.</span></p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">The
              flashcards
              will play the pronunciation automatically only if the English card is
              displayed first. The program will remember which side of the card is
              displayed, so use it for your benefit. I personally like to learn the
              English card first and the Czech card second, but I use this exercise
            to learn the Czech card too.</p></td>
