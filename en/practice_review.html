          options which you can choose and here is a description on what they
          mean:</p>

This answer will increase the word proficiency the most, but you will see the word again in a longer interval.&nbsp; You know the word now, but the program will check again in few weeks if you still remember the flashcard. </td>

you flip it.<br>
</strong>It takes time  to learn new words and this option
will help you to learn the word at your pace. The program will try to
repeat the word again in few days, so you will learn it faster. <br>
Sometimes I use this option to slow the learning down and when I want
to learn the word thoroughly. I use this when I get closer to mastering
the word (ie. Green proficiency), but I don't feel comfortable
to&nbsp; enable the next level card.</td>

              don't hesitate too much to use this option, there is nothing bad
about this answer and you will focus on learning these words again
today. This answer will reduce your proficiency rating for this card
just a bit and the program will try to show this card again as soon as
possible. This option will help you to focus on learning this word more
seriously.<br>
            <br>
You can use this option to learn the flashcard better, because this word will be reviewed as soon as possible.</td>

              This answer is only available from the menu. It  completes all flashcard levels and you will never see the card again. You should use this option only for words with native-like proficiency. don't use it if you learned the word just
                recently, because the word will be not repeated.</p>
