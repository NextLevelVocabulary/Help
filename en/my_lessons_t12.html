    <td width="91%" valign="top"><p>My Lessons page will display all lessons downloaded to your phone or tablet. All downloaded lessons  can be learned at any time and all words will be added to your active vocabulary. </p>
        <p>Your learning should be focused  and your should avoid learning too many words at once. This is why you can only download 50 lessons as a maximum to your phone or tablet. All your lessons will remain active on the web, which allows you to return to your previous lessons if needed. </p>
        <p><strong>Tip : </strong>Keep your lessons limited to a manageable volume and do not &ldquo;try to boil the ocean&rdquo;. Trying to learn too many words at once will not result in long-term word retention. My Lessons is meant to boost your short-term memory retention and you should switch to the long-term daily learning within a month. Delete old lessons and rely on the &ldquo;Spaced repetition&rdquo; algorithm  to learn the words at the right intervals to build long lasting knowledge. Use the Date Filter to display older lessons and delete unused records to maintain your lessons updated.</p></td>
