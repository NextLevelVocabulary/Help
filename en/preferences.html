            might need to increase the values initially. You might not be able learn more

    cards per day</strong></span><span style="background: transparent"> &ndash; select the maximum cards you can miss during the Review activity. This is useful if the words in your dictionary are
    becoming very difficult to learn. You can limit how many words you
    can miss in one day. This is particularly   important if you are
    learning on a bus or subway and you have limited time to learn,    because the more words you miss, the longer it takes to learn them. </span></li>

      understand English words first. Once I am comfortable understanding
      the words, I want to be able to express myself and I want to learn
